            <h1 class="text-sm">Founder of Dhaka Credit</h1>
            <p class="py-6 text-xs">The pioneer of the credit union movement in Bangladesh, Fr.Charles J. Young CSC was born in May 3rd 1904, in New York, USA. His full name is Fr. Charles Joseph Young CSC. He was the founder of "The Christian Co-Operative Credit Union Ltd. Dhaka," the largest credit union in Bangladesh and south Asia. Fr. Charles joined the seminary of the holy cross on September on 1923, and joined in the first verse in 1925 & accepted his blessing in 1928.In 1929,he obtained his BA degree from Notre Dame University of America. Later in 1933, after studying the theory of theism at the foreign mission seminary in Washington, he was promoted to a priest at "Indiana Notre Dame University chapel". And in the same year, he came to Bangladesh as a foreign missionary and did various pastoral and social activities in Dhaka and Mymensingh. In 1953, Lawrence L. Grenar CSC, Archbishop of Dhaka sent him to the Coady Institute of St. Francis Xavier University in Canada to acquire knowledge on co-operatives. In 1955, coming back to Dhaka, he established "The Christian Co-Operative Credit Union Ltd. Dhaka" (Dhaka Credit) to bring the socio-economic development of the Christian community of the country.His philosophy in the credit movement has spread widely throughout the country. This theory brings radical changes in people’s lives. later, using this theory, the non-governmental organization "Grameen Bank" won the Nobel peace prize. Many organizations in the country are working in light of this theory. "The Christian Co-Operative Credit Union Ltd. Dhaka" is now one of the largest Credit Union in South Asia of its kind. The name of Fr. Charles J. Young CSC will be written in the history of the Credit Movement of this region. He died on 14 November, 1988 in a tragic road accident. He was buried in Tejgaon Holy Rosary Church in Dhaka. His death anniversary is celebrated every year with due honor.

            <p class="py-6 text-xs">In the fifties, the economic condition of Christian community of this region was extremely bad. They had to borrow money at very high interest from the usurious moneylenders. Observing this situation, the then Archbishop Lawrence Leo Grenar, CSC became very anxious. He started thinking how the economic condition of these Christians could be developed. He sent Reverent Father Charles Joseph Young CSC to Coady Institute, Canada for training on Co-operative. After receiving training, Father Charles Joseph Young CSC established `The Christian Co-operative Credit Union Limited, Dhaka (Dhaka Credit)’ in 3rd July, 1955 at Luxmibazar with only 50 members. With the establishment of Dhaka Credit, the Credit Union movement has been spaded though out the country afterword. Now, Dhaka Credit is the largest and oldest Co-operative Credit Union of its kind in Bangladesh. Dhaka Credit was awarded best cooperative award (Gold Medal) from the government of Bangladesh for its remarkable contributions in co-operative sectors.

            <br>Having vision to be A SMART and leading Co-operative Credit Union in Bangladesh and Asia to attain self-reliant and dignified community, Dhaka Credit is working hard. At present we are an organization of 86 product-service and projects having 45,546 members and total BDT 1188 Crore assets. Dhaka Credit is working in 4 Districts (Dhaka, Narayangonj, Gazipur and Munshigonj) with 12 Service Centers and 23 Collection booths.
